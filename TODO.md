# TIN Matching Service - Development TODO

## Phase 1: Foundation (Test Each Step)

### âœ… COMPLETED
**Step 1.1: Basic HTML + Phaser Setup**
- [x] Create index.html with Phaser CDN
- [x] Create minimal game.js with empty Phaser config
- [x] Test: Game loads without errors, shows empty canvas

**Step 1.2: Add Player**
- [x] Add green 32x32 rectangle as player at center (400, 300)
- [x] Test: Green square appears in center

**Step 1.3: Player Movement**
- [x] Add WASD key handlers in create()
- [x] Implement movement in update() (200px/second speed)
- [x] Add world boundaries (stay within 800x600)
- [x] Test: Player moves smoothly with WASD, can't leave screen

**Step 1.4: Basic Box Spawning**
- [x] Create boxes array
- [x] Add spawnBox() function (brown 32x32 rectangle)
- [x] Set timer to spawn box every 5 seconds at (50, 300)
- [x] Add simple ID labels to boxes
- [x] Add box limit: maximum 100 boxes on screen (stop spawning when limit reached)
- [x] Test: Boxes appear every 5 seconds on left side, stops at 100 boxes

**Step 1.5: Pick Up/Drop Mechanics**
- [x] Add E key handler for interaction
- [x] Implement distance-based collision detection (< 50px)
- [x] Create pickupBox() function (remove from world, store in inventory)
- [x] Show carried box as small rectangle following player
- [x] Add Q key handler for dropBox()
- [x] Test: Can pick up boxes with E, drop with Q

## Phase 2: Core Game Loop

**Step 2.1: IRS Machine**
- [x] Add gray 64x48 rectangle at (650, 300) with "IRS MACHINE" label
- [x] Add interaction when player with box approaches machine
- [x] Create processBox() function with 3-second timer
- [x] Show "PROCESSING..." status during timer
- [x] Generate random result (0 or 1) after 3 seconds
- [x] Change box color (green=1, red=0) and show result number
- [x] Test: Player can submit boxes, see processing, get results

**Step 2.2: TIN Data Generation**
- [x] Add tin property to each box (9-digit string)
- [x] Generate random TINs for each box
- [x] Create list of obviously bad TINs: 000000000, 111111111, 999999999, 123456789
- [x] Create simple TIN validation logic:
  - Obviously bad TINs â†’ always return 0 (invalid)
  - Other TINs â†’ 50% chance of being valid (random)
- [x] Test: Obviously bad TINs always fail, others are random 50/50

**Step 2.3: Result Return Station**
- [x] Add blue 64x48 rectangle at (650, 450) with "RETURN RESULTS" label
- [x] Allow player to submit processed boxes (with 0 or 1 results)
- [x] Check if player's result matches actual TIN validity
- [x] Test: Player can return processed boxes to get payment

**Step 2.4: 0-Card Shortcut System**
- [x] Add SPACE key handler for "Use 0-card" 
- [x] When player presses SPACE while carrying box, automatically assign result=0
- [x] Mark box as "assigned via SPACE" (track how result was assigned)
- [x] Change box color to red and show "0" label (bypassing IRS machine)
- [x] Add SPACE toggle: if box already has 0-result from SPACE, pressing SPACE again resets to no result
- [x] Reset functionality ONLY works for SPACE-assigned results (not IRS machine results)
- [x] Player can then submit processed box directly to Return Station
- [x] Test: Player can assign 0-card with SPACE, toggle it off with SPACE again, but cannot reset IRS results

**Step 3.1: Timer and Difficulty**
- [x] Add 30-minute game timer (display in top-right)
- [x] Increase box spawn rate over time (start 5s, decrease to 2s minimum)
- [x] Decrease IRS processing time over time (start 3s, decrease to 1s minimum)
- [x] Add box expiration system based on game pace
- [x] Test: Game gets progressively harder over time

### âœ… COMPLETED
**Step 3.2: Level System**
- [x] Add level variable (start at 0 = Junior, removed Intern)
- [x] Define promotion thresholds: Junior($0), Mid($500), Senior($1200), Architect($2500), CEO($5000)
- [x] Display current level in top-center
- [x] Add level buffs: Junior(+speed), Mid(+carry 2 boxes +speed), Senior(+IRS slots +speed), Architect(+pre-validated boxes), CEO(+carry 3 boxes +more speed)
- [x] Multi-box carrying system implemented
- [x] IRS slots system implemented (Senior: 2 slots, CEO: 3 slots)
- [x] Test: Player can earn promotions and get buffs

### âœ… COMPLETED
**Step 3.3: Happiness System**
- [x] Add happiness variable (start at 0, range -100 to +100)
- [x] Add happiness meter display with color coding
- [x] Penalize happiness for wrong results (-10), missed deadlines (-5)
- [x] Happiness affects payment multiplier (0.1x to 2.0x range)
- [x] Game over if happiness reaches -100
- [x] Test: Mistakes affect happiness and earnings

### ðŸ”„ CURRENT TASK

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

**Step 4.1: Election System (Simplified)**
- [ ] Add 3 simple candidates with basic effects
- [ ] Trigger elections every 10 minutes (for testing)
- [ ] Simple voting interface (press 1, 2, or 3)
- [ ] Apply winner's effects (speed up/down, payment changes)
- [ ] Test: Elections change gameplay meaningfully

**Step 4.2: Tesla System (Basic)**
- [ ] Unlock after 3rd election
- [ ] Add one Tesla type ($500, +25% election influence)
- [ ] Simple purchase interface
- [ ] Test: Tesla purchases affect election outcomes

## Development Rules

1. **One step at a time** - Don't move to next until current works
2. **Test everything** - Each step must be verified working
3. **Keep it simple** - Minimal code, no over-engineering
4. **Debug first** - Fix issues before adding features
5. **Single file** - Keep everything in game.js initially

## File Structure (Minimal)
```
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html      # Basic HTML + Phaser CDN
â”œâ”€â”€ game.js         # All game logic (single file)
â””â”€â”€ TODO.md         # This file
```

## Current Status: READY FOR STEP 4.1
Steps 1.1-3.3 COMPLETED: Core game + Timer/Difficulty + Level System + Happiness System! Players can earn promotions (Junior â†’ Mid â†’ Senior â†’ Architect â†’ CEO) with buffs including multi-box carrying, IRS processing slots, and pre-validated boxes. Happiness system affects payment multipliers and provides game over condition. All systems working!
Ready to implement Step 4.1: Election System (Simplified)
